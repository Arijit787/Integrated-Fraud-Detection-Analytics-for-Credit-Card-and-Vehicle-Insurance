Project Title: Integrated Fraud Detection Analytics for Credit Card and Vehicle Insurance (Excel, MYSQL, Power BI[Power Query, DAX, Visualization], Python[Pandas])


Project Objectives:

The goal was to implement advanced analytics and Business Intelligence (BI) tools for fraud prevention, aiming to detect, reduce, and investigate fraudulent activities in credit card and vehicle insurance sectors.

Key Achievements:

• Classification System Development: Created a robust classification system capable of identifying fraudulent activities associated with credit card transactions and vehicle insurance claims. This system utilized advanced algorithms to analyze patterns and anomalies, facilitating early fraud detection.

• Database Management: Effectively managed MySQL databases, optimizing schema and enhancing the fraud detection system's performance. This involved structuring the databases to efficiently store and retrieve data, ultimately improving the accuracy and efficiency of fraud detection processes.

• Dynamic Power BI Dashboards: Designed dynamic Power BI dashboards providing real-time insights into fraud activities. These dashboards offered actionable metrics and visualizations, empowering stakeholders to make informed decisions and take proactive measures to mitigate fraud risks effectively.

Impact:

• Enhanced Fraud Detection: The classification system and optimized database management improved the accuracy and efficiency of fraud detection processes, leading to a reduction in fraudulent activities.

• Real-Time Insights: The dynamic Power BI dashboards provided stakeholders with timely insights into fraud trends, enabling them to respond swiftly to emerging threats and vulnerabilities.

• Cost Reduction: By minimizing fraudulent activities, the project contributed to cost savings for credit card issuers and insurance companies, enhancing overall profitability.
Improved Customer Trust: Strengthened fraud prevention measures instilled confidence in customers, enhancing trust and loyalty towards the organizations.
